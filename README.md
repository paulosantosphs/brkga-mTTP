# brkga-mTTP
Related to sports scheduling problems, the Mirrored Traveling Tournament Problem
(mTTP) is an optimization problem classified as NP-Hard which aims to produce the schedule of
sports tournaments with the objective of minimizing the total distance traveled by all the teams
of the tournament. This code applies the metaheuristic Biased
Random-Key Genetic Algorithm associated with the Polygon Method in ordeer to solve the mTTP. VND and Simulated Annealing are also are also implemented.
This code runs the two main sets of instances from the literature (CIRC and NL) avaliable on http://mat.tepper.cmu.edu/TOURN/ .
